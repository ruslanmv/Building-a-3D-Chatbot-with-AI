## **Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

### **Install Required Libraries**
Before you begin, set up the environment by installing the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install openai pygltflib pygame vrm pyttsx3
```

- **`openai`:** To integrate ChatGPT for conversation.
- **`pygltflib`:** To load, modify, and save 3D glTF models.
- **`pygame`:** To create a simple window for rendering animations.
- **`vrm`:** To work with VRM models for advanced character interactions.
- **`pyttsx3`:** For text-to-speech functionality to enhance interactivity.

---

## **Step 2: Selecting Your 3D Model**

### **Choose a Model**
Find a suitable 3D model from online resources like:
- [**Sketchfab**](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [**Mixamo**](https://www.mixamo.com/)
- [**Turbosquid**](https://www.turbosquid.com/)

### **File Formats**
- **glTF/GLB:** Ideal for animations due to its lightweight nature.
- **VRM:** Perfect for Vtuber-style characters with predefined expressions.

Download your chosen model and ensure it's in one of the supported formats.

---

## **Step 3: Accessing ChatGPT**

Sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to obtain your API key. Store it securely in an environment variable or `.env` file. Here's an example of `.env` configuration:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Install `python-dotenv` to load the API key securely:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

### **Code to Load the API Key**

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

---

## **Step 4: Building the Core Chatbot Application**

### **Code Implementation**
Create a Python script to handle the chatbot's core functionalities. This script includes ChatGPT integration, loading the 3D model, and user input handling.

```python
import openai
import pygltflib
import pygame
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
pygame.display.set_caption("3D Chatbot")

# Load 3D model (glTF format)
model = pygltflib.GLTF2().load("character_model.glb")

# Function to interact with ChatGPT
def get_chat_response(user_input):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=user_input,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Main event loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key == pygame.K_RETURN:
            user_input = input("You: ")
            chatbot_response = get_chat_response(user_input)
            print(f"Chatbot: {chatbot_response}")

pygame.quit()
```

---

## **Step 5: Mapping ChatGPT Responses to Animations**

### **Analyze the AI Response**
This section uses sentiment analysis to determine the appropriate animations for responses.

```python
def analyze_response(response):
    if "happy" in response.lower():
        return "smile"
    elif "wave" in response.lower():
        return "wave"
    else:
        return "neutral"
```

### **Update Animations**
Apply the animation dynamically to the 3D model:

```python
def apply_animation(animation_type):
    # Example: Update model node properties for specific animations
    if animation_type == "wave":
        arm_node = next((node for node in model.nodes if node.name == "RightArm"), None)
        if arm_node:
            arm_node.rotation = [0, 0.5, 0, 1]  # Example rotation
    elif animation_type == "smile":
        mouth_node = next((node for node in model.nodes if node.name == "Mouth"), None)
        if mouth_node:
            mouth_node.scale = [1.2, 1.2, 1.2]
```

---

## **Step 6: Adding Lip Sync**

### **Text-to-Speech**
Generate speech using `pyttsx3`:

```python
import pyttsx3

def generate_speech(text):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()
```

---

## **Step 7: Rendering the 3D Character**

### **Setup Rendering**
Use `pygame` to display the rendered 3D model.

```python
def render():
    # Placeholder for rendering logic
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen
    pygame.display.flip()  # Update display
```

Integrate the `render` function into the main loop.

---

## **Frontend Implementation**

For a web-based frontend, you can use Flask or Django along with Three.js for rendering 3D models. Below is a simple Flask setup:

### **Flask App**

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### **HTML Template (`templates/index.html`)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>3D Chatbot</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/110/three.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="chatbot-container"></div>
    <script>
        // Placeholder for Three.js rendering logic
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

```



### **Step 8: Testing and Refinement**
1. **Interaction:** Ensure ChatGPT accurately responds to user input.
2. **Animation:** Verify smooth transitions between animations.
3. **Lip Sync:** Test alignment of mouth movements with speech.

Refining and testing the chatbot involves three critical aspects: ensuring ChatGPT responds correctly, verifying animations, and testing the alignment of lip sync with speech output.

---

#### **Interaction: Ensure ChatGPT Accurately Responds to User Input**

Test the interaction loop for ChatGPT to ensure the AI is producing meaningful and relevant responses. Use a sample conversation flow and validate the outputs.

```python
def test_chat_response():
    test_inputs = [
        "What is your name?",
        "Tell me a joke.",
        "Can you describe a happy moment?",
    ]
    
    for user_input in test_inputs:
        response = get_chat_response(user_input)
        print(f"User: {user_input}")
        print(f"ChatGPT: {response}\n")

# Run the test
test_chat_response()
```

Ensure the responses are coherent and contextually relevant. If issues arise, adjust the prompt engineering in the `get_chat_response` function.

---

#### **Animation: Verify Smooth Transitions Between Animations**

Smooth animation transitions require blending between animation states. Using the `pygltflib` library, implement a test for checking transitions.

```python
def test_animation_transitions():
    animations = ["neutral", "wave", "smile"]
    
    for anim in animations:
        print(f"Applying animation: {anim}")
        apply_animation(anim)
        # Simulate a delay for visualization (use rendering in a real test)
        import time
        time.sleep(2)

# Run the test
test_animation_transitions()
```

Monitor the transition to verify that the animations are smooth and logical. Debug any abrupt changes in the `apply_animation` function.

---

#### **Lip Sync: Test Alignment of Mouth Movements with Speech**

Test lip sync by comparing the audio output and mouth movements for a given text input.

```python
def test_lip_sync():
    test_phrases = [
        "Hello, how are you?",
        "I am a 3D chatbot.",
        "Let’s test lip sync now."
    ]
    
    for phrase in test_phrases:
        print(f"Testing phrase: {phrase}")
        generate_speech(phrase)
        phonemes = ["A", "E", "I", "O", "U"]  # Simplified example
        sync_mouth(phonemes)
        import time
        time.sleep(3)

# Run the test
test_lip_sync()
```

Validate that the mouth animations are consistent with the generated speech. Adjust phoneme mapping if needed.

---

### **Advanced Features (Optional)**
- **Emotion Detection:** Use Hugging Face's Transformers for advanced sentiment analysis.
- **Interactive Environments:** Add a 3D scene with props using `three.js` or Blender.
- **Customization:** Allow users to customize the character's appearance and personality.
#### **Emotion Detection: Use Hugging Face's Transformers for Advanced Sentiment Analysis**

Incorporate a pre-trained model from Hugging Face for detailed sentiment analysis and emotion detection.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

def detect_emotion(response):
    analysis = sentiment_analyzer(response)
    sentiment = analysis[0]["label"]
    score = analysis[0]["score"]
    print(f"Detected Sentiment: {sentiment} (Confidence: {score:.2f})")
    return sentiment

# Test emotion detection
response = "I am so happy to see you!"
emotion = detect_emotion(response)
print(f"Emotion detected: {emotion}")
```

Use the detected emotions to enhance animations or trigger specific behaviors.

---

#### **Interactive Environments: Add a 3D Scene with Props Using Three.js or Blender**

For an immersive experience, incorporate a dynamic 3D environment. Example with `three.js`:

```html
<!-- Include a 3D environment with Three.js -->
<div id="scene-container"></div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
<script>
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
    const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.add(cube);

    camera.position.z = 5;

    function animate() {
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
        cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
        renderer.render(scene, camera);
    }
    animate();
</script>
```

This example creates a simple rotating cube. Replace it with more complex models and props for a fully interactive environment.

---

#### **Customization: Allow Users to Customize the Character's Appearance and Personality**

Provide options to modify the character’s visual attributes or conversational style dynamically. Example:

```python
def customize_character(color="blue", personality="friendly"):
    # Customize color
    if color == "blue":
        print("Applying blue color to the character.")
        # Apply customization logic (e.g., change texture in glTF model)
    # Customize personality
    if personality == "friendly":
        print("Setting chatbot personality to friendly.")
        # Adjust response style in ChatGPT prompt

# Test customization
customize_character(color="red", personality="humorous")
```

Use sliders, dropdowns, or input fields in the frontend to capture user preferences and apply them to the character.

---

By incorporating these testing routines and advanced features, you ensure the 3D chatbot is robust, interactive, and engaging for users.
